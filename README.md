# Connectographics

# Description
Understanding the structural and functional connectivity of the human brain is crucial for advancing research in neuroscience, neurology, and cognitive science. Connectomics, the comprehensive mapping of neural connections, often requires specialized tools and expertise to visualize complex data. Connectographics addresses this challenge by offering a user-friendly graphical interface to visualize human connectomes. By integrating with established neuroimaging data formats and connectivity matrices, the platform enables researchers and clinicians to explore neural networks with minimal technical barriers.
